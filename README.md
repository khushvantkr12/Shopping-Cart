# Shopping Cart (Ecomzy)

The Shopping Cart, also known as [Ecomzy](https://66471eba3800ea92cf2b7764--dreamy-malabi-266238.netlify.app/), is a simple web application built during [web development bootcamp] to understand the concept of store and slices in React.js. It demonstrates the basic functionality of a shopping cart, allowing users to add products, adjust quantities, and calculate the total price. The application utilizes React, HTML, and CSS (Tailwind) to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. [Ecomzy]
